Type-aware test input generator with static analysis backend.

## Introduction

Testing is mature way to enhance software quality. But generating test suites manually is always a hard job and full of imperfections.

And especially for python, usually there are no type informations in code itself. So generating test inputs automatically is a hard job.

So we thought up a way to get type informations vis static analysis beforehand, and using that information to enhance test input quality.

Furthermore, we also propose a novel way to improve static analysis quality.
